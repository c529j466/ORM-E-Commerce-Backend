# ORM-E-Commerce-Backend

## Description


For this project, I was tasked with integrating the ORM, Sequalize, into an e-commerce app. The project uses MySql models and seeds for the data and then uses Sequalize to better manipulate and retrieve that data. The project needed routes for GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE options for the different categories, products and tags in the e-commerce models. The project functioned in that a schema is run to create the database, the database is seeded with data, sequalize is used to help with routing of this data, and then the user can interact with this data. My motivation to complete this project was to better understand Object Relational Mapping libraries and how they help on the backend to better use data. I also wanted to improve my knowledge specifically on Sequalize and how it works with MySql models to better manipulate data in those models. Along with this, I also wanted to further my knowledge on how to design routes on the backend of apps. 

## Installation

To see the backend functionality I added, a user would want to run the schema in their terminal, seed the database that is created from that schema with data, run npm start to start the server, and then could use an application such as Insomnia to test the different CRUD routes for the e-commerce app I added.
